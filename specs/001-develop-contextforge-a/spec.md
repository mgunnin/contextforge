# Feature Specification: ContextForge Platform Development

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-contextforge-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop contextforge, A unified, local-first platform for collecting, organizing, optimizing, and personalizing all context artifacts (prompts, agent definitions, IDE rules, and more) for AI-powered software development. Our current app is lacking the core features that we need for our app including ai optimization, categorization, perfect importing from github and local folders/files. Buttons should be working and actually performing the action they are supposed to perform. This app is initially just going to be used locally so security and other features that are typical for public apps is not needed. Review our current codebase and clean up any artifacts and no longer implemented/integrated code as well."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As an AI-powered software developer, I need a unified local platform to collect, organize, optimize, and personalize all my context artifacts (prompts, agent definitions, IDE rules, etc.) so that I can efficiently manage and reuse my AI development resources without relying on external services.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have context artifacts scattered across different locations, **When** I use the import functionality, **Then** all artifacts are successfully imported and categorized automatically
2. **Given** I have imported context artifacts, **When** I want to organize them, **Then** I can categorize, tag, and search through them efficiently
3. **Given** I have existing context artifacts, **When** I request AI optimization, **Then** the system improves the quality and effectiveness of my artifacts
4. **Given** I click on any functional button in the interface, **When** the action is triggered, **Then** the button performs its intended function correctly
5. **Given** I want to import from GitHub repositories, **When** I provide a repository URL, **Then** all relevant context artifacts are imported seamlessly
6. **Given** I want to import from local folders, **When** I select local directories, **Then** all supported files are imported with proper categorization

### Edge Cases

- What happens when import sources contain unsupported file formats?
- How does the system handle duplicate context artifacts during import?
- What occurs when AI optimization fails or produces unexpected results?
- How does the system behave when local storage limits are reached?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a unified interface for managing all context artifacts locally
- **FR-002**: System MUST support importing context artifacts from GitHub repositories with full fidelity
- **FR-003**: System MUST support importing context artifacts from local folders and files
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically categorize imported context artifacts by type and purpose
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide AI-powered optimization capabilities for improving context artifacts
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all user interface buttons perform their intended actions correctly
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to organize artifacts through tagging, categorization, and search
- **FR-008**: System MUST operate entirely locally without requiring external services or internet connectivity
- **FR-009**: System MUST identify and remove obsolete or unused code artifacts from the codebase
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide personalization features for customizing the user experience
- **FR-011**: System MUST support multiple context artifact types including prompts, agent definitions, IDE rules, and configuration files
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide efficient search and filtering capabilities across all managed artifacts

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Context Artifact**: Any reusable piece of content for AI development including prompts, agent definitions, IDE rules, configuration files, and code snippets
- **Category**: Classification system for organizing context artifacts by type, purpose, or domain
- **Import Source**: External location for context artifacts including GitHub repositories, local folders, and individual files
- **Optimization Result**: AI-enhanced version of a context artifact with improved quality, clarity, or effectiveness
- **User Workspace**: Personal collection of organized and optimized context artifacts tailored to individual development needs
