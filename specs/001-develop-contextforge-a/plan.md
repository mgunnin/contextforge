# Implementation Plan: ContextForge Platform Development

**Branch**: `001-develop-contextforge-a` | **Date**: 2025-09-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-develop-contextforge-a/spec.md`
**Technical Context**: Generate the plan based on the current codebase architecture and documentation that is current.

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path ✅
   → Feature spec loaded and analyzed
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION) ✅
   → Project Type: Web application (Next.js + React)
   → Structure Decision: Option 1 (Single project)
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below ✅
   → Initial violations documented in Complexity Tracking
   → Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md ✅
   → All technical unknowns resolved
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md ✅
   → Design artifacts complete
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section ✅
   → Post-design violations addressed
   → Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach ✅
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Enhance ContextForge as a unified, local-first platform for AI development context management. Core enhancements include AI-powered optimization, auto-categorization, robust GitHub/local imports, functional UI fixes, and code cleanup. Technical approach leverages existing Next.js + Prisma + multi-AI infrastructure with Bull queue processing for background operations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Next.js 15.4.6  
**Primary Dependencies**: Prisma 6.15.0 (SQLite), React 19.1.0, Radix UI, Multiple AI SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)  
**Storage**: SQLite database with local file system for artifacts  
**Testing**: Playwright for E2E, existing test framework to be verified  
**Target Platform**: Local web application (localhost:3001)
**Project Type**: Web application - single Next.js project  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms semantic search, <60s large imports, <100ms UI interactions  
**Constraints**: Local-first (no external services), multi-AI support, preserve existing data  
**Scale/Scope**: 10,000+ artifacts, single-user, hierarchical organization, 20+ file types

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Simplicity**:

- Projects: 1 (Next.js web application) ✅
- Using framework directly? Yes (Next.js, Prisma, Radix UI) ✅
- Single data model? Enhanced existing Prisma schema ✅
- Avoiding patterns? No unnecessary abstractions ✅

**Architecture**:

  - `lib/search/semantic` - Vector-based search
  - `lib/validation/ui` - Button functionality fixes
- CLI per library: Each library exports CLI commands for testing ✅
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned for each library ✅

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:

- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? ✅ (Contract tests written first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? ✅ (Required workflow)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? ✅
- Real dependencies used? ✅ (Actual SQLite, real AI APIs)
- Integration tests for: ✅
  - New AI optimization library
  - Enhanced import contracts
  - Search API changes
  - Database schema modifications
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase ✅

**Observability**:

- Frontend logs → backend? ✅ (Error reporting via API)
- Error context sufficient? ✅ (Request IDs, user context)

**Versioning**:

- Version number assigned? 0.2.0 (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change? ✅ (Automated in CI)
- Breaking changes handled? ✅ (Database migrations, API versioning)

**Structure Decision**: Using existing Next.js structure (Option 1 enhanced) as current architecture aligns perfectly

## Phase 0: Outline & Research ✅

All technical unknowns resolved in [research.md](research.md):

**Key Research Findings**:

- **AI Optimization**: Multi-provider approach using existing infrastructure
- **Categorization**: Extend existing semantic search with auto-classification
- **GitHub Import**: Enhance with Octokit integration (already available)
- **Local Import**: Extend existing upload system with recursive processing
- **Search Enhancement**: Leverage existing SemanticSearch model
- **Button Fixes**: Systematic UI interaction audit
- **Code Cleanup**: Incremental removal using TypeScript compiler analysis

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved ✅

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✅

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

**Completed Artifacts**:

1. **Data model extraction** → `data-model.md` ✅:

   - Enhanced existing Item/Collection models
   - New OptimizationResult, ImportQueue entities
   - Preserved existing relationships
   - Added AI-specific fields and validation

2. **API contracts generation** → `/contracts/*.yaml` ✅:

   - AI Optimization API (async job processing)
   - Enhanced Import API (GitHub + local)
   - Advanced Search API (semantic + filtering)
   - OpenAPI 3.0 schemas with validation

3. **Integration test scenarios** → `quickstart.md` ✅:

   - User story validation workflows
   - Performance benchmarks
   - API health checks
   - Troubleshooting guides

4. **Agent context update** → `CLAUDE.md` ✅:
   - Current project state
   - Technology stack details
   - Development conventions
   - Architecture decisions

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md ✅

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base framework
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API contract → contract test task [P] (parallel execution)
- Each enhanced entity → database migration + model update task [P]
- Each user story → integration test scenario task
- Implementation tasks ordered by dependency (tests before implementation)

**Categorization by Feature Area**:

1. **Database & Models (5-7 tasks)**

   - Prisma schema migrations [P]
   - Enhanced model definitions [P]
   - Database seed data updates [P]
   - Index optimization

2. **AI Optimization Engine (6-8 tasks)**

   - Multi-provider AI service library
   - Optimization queue processing
   - Content enhancement algorithms
   - API endpoint implementation
   - Contract tests for AI endpoints
   - Integration tests with real AI providers

3. **Import System Enhancement (6-8 tasks)**

   - GitHub import library with Octokit
   - Local file processing enhancements
   - Recursive directory handling
   - Auto-categorization during import
   - Import progress tracking
   - API endpoint implementations

4. **Search & Filtering (4-6 tasks)**

   - Semantic search with embeddings
   - Faceted filtering implementation
   - Search performance optimization
   - API endpoint enhancements

5. **UI Fixes & Code Cleanup (4-6 tasks)**

   - Button functionality audit
   - Event handler fixes
   - Deprecated code removal
   - Performance optimizations

6. **Testing & Validation (6-8 tasks)**
   - Contract test suite completion
   - Integration test scenarios
   - E2E test workflows
   - Performance benchmark tests
   - Quickstart validation

**Ordering Strategy**:

- **TDD Order**: Contract tests → Integration tests → Implementation → Unit tests
- **Dependency Order**: Database migrations → Libraries → API endpoints → UI components
- **Parallel Markers [P]**: Independent database migrations, library development, contract tests

**Estimated Task Count**: 31-43 tasks across 6 feature areas
**Critical Path**: Database migrations → AI libraries → Import enhancements → UI integration
**Parallel Execution**: Database changes, library development, contract test writing

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                 | Why Needed                 | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple AI providers     | Resilience and user choice | Single provider creates vendor lock-in, reduces reliability   |
| Background job processing | Large imports block UI     | Synchronous processing creates poor UX for 1000+ file imports |
