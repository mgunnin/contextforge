# Legacy Tests

These Jest-based test suites referenced outdated infrastructure and missing dependencies. They have been archived here to keep history available while preventing the main TypeScript type-check from failing. If you decide to revive automated tests, migrate the relevant cases into a modern setup and delete the unused files.
